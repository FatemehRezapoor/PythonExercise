# This time, weâ€™re going to do exactly the opposite. You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100.
# The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.
# At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get your number.
