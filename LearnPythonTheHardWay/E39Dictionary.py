# Dictionary

# You can use numbers to “index” into a list, meaning you can use numbers to fi nd out what’s in lists.
# What a dict does is let you use anything, not just numbers. Yes, a dict associates one thing to
# another, no matter what it is.
# Dictionaries are indexed by keys: string or number
# IMPORTANT: You can't use lsit as a key since list can be modified by append ,...
# The key to the dictionary needs to be immutable
