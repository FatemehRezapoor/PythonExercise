# HOW TO OVERRIDE A PARENT CLASS

class shark(Fish):
    # Because we want to over write parents we need to start with init
    def __init__(self, firstname, lastname='Shark'):
        self.lastname = lastname
        self.firstname = firstname

sharky = shark('Sharky')
print(sharky.lastname)


# print(sharky.body) # Becasue you use init, you have changed the whole attributes

# * IMPORTANT: When ever you use init in the child, you are changing the parents *

# How to change a part of parents but use other attributes?
# Super() function will do this

class domsia(Fish):
    def __init__(self, Behaviour='Bad Boy'):  # over writes thw whole parents
        self.Behaviour = Behaviour
        super().__init__(self)  # Re read the whole parents


Domy = domsia()  # starts the class with your new sets.
print(Domy.Behaviour)
# To call sth from paretns you need ti initialise the paretns
# Parents needs a first name to initialise
Domy.firstname = 'Domy'  # parents is called
print(Domy.lastname)
Domy.swim()
